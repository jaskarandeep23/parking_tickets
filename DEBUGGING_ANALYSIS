# Debugging Steps — Parking Tickets App

This file documents three debugger breakpoints required by the assignment. For each breakpoint there are two screenshots: the paused state and the state after stepping.

---

## Breakpoint 1 — Before the API request
**Location in code:** `fetchTickets()` — the line that performs `fetch(apiUrl)`

**Why:** Verify the constructed URL and inputs before sending the network request.

**Screenshot (paused):** `screenshot1.png`  
**Screenshot (after stepping):** `screenshot1_after.png`

**What I inspected:**
- `searchTerm` = `<fill in the term you used>`  
- `endpoint` = `https://data.winnipeg.ca/resource/bhrt-29rb.json`  
- `apiUrl` (encoded) = `<paste full URL shown in DevTools>`

**Observations:**
- The `apiUrl` was formed properly and encoded.
- After stepping the response object showed `status: 200` (OK).

---

## Breakpoint 2 — After parsing the API response
**Location in code:** `fetchTickets()` — at `const data = await response.json();`

**Why:** Confirm the JSON was parsed correctly and inspect result size and structure.

**Screenshot (paused):** `screenshot2.png`  
**Screenshot (after stepping):** `screenshot2_after.png`

**What I inspected:**
- `data.length` = `<number>`  
- Example `data[0]` fields: `ticket_number`, `contravention_date`, `set_fine_amount`, `offence_description`

**Observations:**
- The dataset returned `<data.length>` records for the query.
- `set_fine_amount` may be returned as a string; I convert it to Number when rendering.

---

## Breakpoint 3 — At start of renderTable(data)
**Location in code:** `renderTable(data)` — first line of function

**Why:** Ensure table columns are correct and DOM insertion behaves as expected.

**Screenshot (paused):** `screenshot3.png`  
**Screenshot (after stepping):** `screenshot3_after.png`

**What I inspected:**
- `data` argument and its length  
- `columns` array used to render the table  
- After stepping: the `<table>` is appended to `#results` and the first row values match expected ticket fields

**Observations:**
- Table is created and appended as expected. Values appear formatted (date and numeric fine formatted).

## Detailed analysis of a critical state (Breakpoint 2)
**State inspected:** After parsing JSON (`data`).

**What it revealed:**  
`data.length` was `<number>` and the first result showed `set_fine_amount` as a string (e.g., `"85.00"`). This is important because client-side numeric operations require numeric types. Although server ordering used SoQL (`$order=set_fine_amount DESC`) ensured correct ordering here, client-side conversions are necessary for future calculations.

**Action taken:**  
In `renderTable()` I defensively convert `set_fine_amount` into a Number before formatting with `toFixed(2)`. If a numeric conversion fails the code falls back to `0` or blank display.

## Notes & how to reproduce
1. Run a local server (recommended): `python -m http.server 8000` and open `http://localhost:8000`.  
2. Open DevTools ► Sources ► open `script.js` ► set breakpoints on the indicated lines.  
3. Enter a search term (e.g., `FIRE LANE`) and submit to trigger breakpoints.  
4. Save the screenshots in this folder and commit them.
